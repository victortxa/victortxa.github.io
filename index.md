This is my personal/academic website as hosted on Github at victortxa.github.io and powered by Jekyll. I almost copied all from [this](http://svmiller.com/blog/2015/08/create-your-website-in-jekyll/) and [this](https://jabranham.com/blog/2016/01/making-academic-website/) Thank you for your help [Steven V. Miller](http://svmiller.com/) and [J. Alexander Branham](https://jabranham.com/).
